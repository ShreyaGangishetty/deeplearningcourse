# Lecture 2 - Linearity, Non-linearity, Simple Networks

This lecture starts with a few primers and builds up to a full neural network that can solve a non-trivial problem.

* [Linear Primer](linear_primer.pdf) - We look at the nature of linearity and linear transformations
* [Numpy](1. numpy.ipynb) - We introduce the `jupyter notebook` and we look at numpy - the language spoken by tensorflow and pytorch (sort of).
* [Non-Linearity](3. Non Linearity.ipynb) - We identify
